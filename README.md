# Linear Regression Model for Predicting Calories Burned

This project focuses on creating a linear regression model for predicting calories burned by users based on data collected from Garmin, a leading sports watch manufacturer. The model utilizes data obtained from three users and employs advanced algorithms to make accurate predictions.

## Data Collection

Data was collected from Garmin's sports watch users and served as the foundation for our model. We utilized state-of-the-art algorithms to gather this data. Additionally, we incorporated meteorological data from AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow's database to enhance the accuracy of our predictions.

## Model Summary

Our algorithm summarizes differences between our predictions and Garmin's algorithm data. This allows us to evaluate how well our model performs in real-world scenarios. For example, we can assess its performance over the course of a week.
